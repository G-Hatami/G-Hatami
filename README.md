# Goli HatamiðŸŒ»

**`Front-end junior learner/developer **`

I'm a 20-year-old student interested in logic, books, volleyball, and food!!!
I'm keen on creating useful content to build an influential approach to programming and the first target is mySelf.
Now I'm trying to work on it and making various improvements, By the way, I'm currently learning JS and Vue3 so any kind of support will help a lot!!!
So as the Bro said, "Seat back, relax, and enjoy the show!!!"
